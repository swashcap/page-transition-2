# [Page Transition 2](http://swashcap.github.io/page-transition-2/)

Another take on page transitions. This time, with client-side routing and an object approach via [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/). Colors inspired by [Kingyoâ€™s Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1536982-Cold-Management-03).
